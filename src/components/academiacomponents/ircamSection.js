            This paper aims to exhibit theoretical implementation of active
            control of the first vibrational modes of cello strings via state
            representation, as well as simulation methods and simulation results
            for pizzicato-excited string vibrations coupled with the cello
            plate. Choosing a relevant physical model for the stringsâ€™ vibration
            allows bibliographical exploitation to achieve theoretical results.
            Time-domain and modal simulation results show convincing realism of
            string sounds, both damped and undamped, coupled with a soundboard
            and uncoupled, and a theoretical transfer function for active string
            control was achieved.

            While time-domain implicit and explicit resolution exhibits spectral
            accuracy divergence for higher frequencies, green-function modal
            synthesis holds well at high frequencies with less than 1% error on
            the significant modes. Modal synthesis proves to be the most
            accurate method of string simulation as well as the most prone to
            implementing the active control algorithm. In the specific case of
            the damped coupled string, the gain matrix for the transducer
            controller to be physically implemented was able to be formalized
            entirely. Additionally, a model for coupled string vibrations in the
            frequency domain was built based on previous biliographical work,
            and proved to fit well based on labmeasured cello mobilities. These
            simulation and theoretical findings pave the way towards numeric
            simulation verification of the theoretical results and experimental
            implementation while taking into account sensor and transducer
            transfer functions

              implemented active control of the first vibrational modes of a

            Recommendation systems have a notable and growing importance in the
            music industry. Be it music streaming platforms, music creation
            tools or music-related social network recommendations, recommender
            systems are part of our everyday music life. Groover specifically is
            a tech company aiming to create opportunities for independent music
            artists by allowing them to send tracks to industry professionnals
            to expand their network, receive feedback, or be promoted by said
            curator. This puts Groover in a specific spot in the recommender
            system space : recommending professionals, who are both users and
            products, to users.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a motivation to improve their current recommendation system, the
            R&D team at Groover wants to include audio features within the
            pipeline to 1. Denoise artist-chosen characteristics by basing
            artist tags on deterministic representation extraction models and 2.
            Providing a new feature of recommending relevant tags to artists
            based on their sample tracks. It is in this context that this
            masterâ€™s internship takes place. The goal is to research state of
            the art of music audio preprocessing techniques and automatic music
            tagging models for later implementation at scale into the
            recommendation system. Music tagging is the task of teaching
            learnable models to label music tracks with relevant labels, such as
            acoustic characteristics, genres, subgenres, instruments, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            A comprehensive study of the state of the art is conducted,
            researching common audio preprocessing techniques in the context of
            machine learning applied to audio, audio tagging models and their
            performance on canonical datasets, and the available datasets to
            construct our own tagging task based in the state of the art.
          </p>
          <p>
            three datasets are exhibited that can be of use to this specific
            tagging task. After model selection based on multiple considerations
            3-4 models are selected to be benchmarked on a custom dataset. Four
            tagging types are isolated to be benchmarked upon : Genres,
            Subgenres, Mood/theme/instruments and All tags combined. A custom
            dataset and split is built for all four of these tagging types. .
            Trained models show competitive results with state of the art on
            appropriate metrics with room for improvement based on the novel
            task of music tagging proposed in this thesis. The interest of
            models as frozen representation learners and standalone learnable
            preprocessing blocks is argued. . Finally, the issue of multi
            instance classification is tackled and it is shown using song-level
            aggregation on the selected datasets that mean pooling results in
            better performance overall on song-level evaluation.
